<div class="lead">
  Hivm is a virtual machine built around the the ideals of <strong>accessibility</strong>, <strong>portability</strong>, and <strong>developer happiness</strong>. It is written in pure ISO C99 and depends only on the Glib runtime library.

  It is a register-based VM and features a simple, concise API. Primitive injection and state examination make it very easy to work with and integrate. Hivm is currently <strong>pre-alpha</strong>, but is in a running state and ready for your experimentation.
