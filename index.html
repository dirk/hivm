title: Hivm, the high-level virtual machine
---
<div class="lead">
  Hivm is a virtual machine built around the the ideals of <strong>accessibility</strong>, <strong>portability</strong>, and <strong>developer happiness</strong>. It is written in pure ISO C99 and depends only on the Glib runtime library.
</div>
<div class="sublead">
  It is a register-based VM and features a simple, concise API. Primitive injection and state examination make it very easy to work with and integrate. Hivm is currently <strong>pre-alpha</strong>, but is in a running state and ready for your experimentation.

  <h4>What does Hivm do?</h4>
  <p>Hivm makes it (relatively) easy to work with virtual machines: be it creating a language or interacting with an existing language/runtime. Hivm builds as both a static and dynamic library: the dynamic library lets you easily run the VM from other languages (eg. <a href="https://github.com/dirk/hivm-ruby">hivm-ruby</a>), the static library allows you to deeply embed the VM in your language or project for optimal performance.</p>
