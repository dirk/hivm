  <h3>Documentation</h3>
  <p>The Hivm documentation is currently a major work in progress and a bit sparse. It is currently divided into 2 sections: the manual and the API documentation. The API docs are built straight from the Hivm source using the Doxygen tool. The manual is available below.</p>
